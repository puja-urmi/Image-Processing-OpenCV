# Image Processing with OpenCV

This repository contains various image processing techniques implemented using OpenCV. The techniques are demonstrated in a Jupyter notebook (`image_processings.ipynb`) with detailed code and explanations.

## Notebook: `image_processings.ipynb`

The notebook covers the following image processing techniques:

1. **Histogram Equalization**
   - Enhances the contrast of images by redistributing pixel intensity values.

2. **Gaussian Smoothing**
   - Reduces image noise and detail by applying a Gaussian blur.

3. **Wavelet Transformation**
   - Decomposes images into multi-resolution components for analysis.

4. **Fourier Transform**
   - Converts spatial domain images to frequency domain for filtering and analysis.

5. **Edge Detection and Enhancement**
   - Detects and enhances image edges using techniques like Sobel, Canny, etc.

6. **Denoising**
   - Removes noise from images while preserving important features.

7. **Sharpening**
   - Enhances the edges and fine details of an image.

8. **Morphological Operations**
   - Includes techniques like dilation, erosion, opening, and closing for shape and structure analysis.

9. **Background Suppression with Image Subtraction**
   - Suppresses the background by subtracting it from the image, highlighting the foreground.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-openCV.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook image_processings.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore each image processing technique.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyWavelets (for wavelet transformation)

Install the dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy jupyter pywavelets
```
